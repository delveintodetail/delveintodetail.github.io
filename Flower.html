<h2>Flower Recognition</h2>

The table shows a comparison between recent publications on the Oxford Flower 102 dataset. To failly compare our feature with new published work [27], we use the same classifier (Adaptive kernel approximation and linear SVM) with them. The mean per-class percent accuracy is applied.

First of all, we want to thank Andrew Zisserman's group for some valuable discussion. The work is firstly motivated by working on flower recognition project. Their works on flower segmentation and recognition are great.

For single feature, PRI-CoLBP outperforms its competitors, such as MSLBP, CoHED, Bag-of-foreground SIFT, color histogram. For feature combination, it also improves the work of Nilsback et al. and Chai's work.
